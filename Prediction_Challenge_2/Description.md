## 💰 Objective

Explore what matters when predicting **future earnings**.

You are predicting a **numerical variable**, and your error will be evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, unlike with categorical variables.

---

## 🧠 Modeling Guidelines

- Use **any learning package** from the recitation  
  *(or any other R package)*
- You may use:
  - Linear regression
  - `rpart` (works well for numerical variables)

📌 **Important principle:**  
Understanding your data before blindly applying ML methods is always a good idea.

Often:
- Transforming the data, or
- Creating new attributes  

can lead to **better—or much better—results**.

## 📊 Data Exploration (Required)

> **Plot, plot, plot…**

Before applying prediction methods:
- Use plots to explore the data
- Look for **regularities and patterns**
- Identify which variables matter most when determining earnings

### Feature Engineering (Encouraged)
- Create new attributes that may be more predictive  
  (e.g., *number of connections × GPA*)
- Be creative

📌 With a bit of **human intervention**, ML results can improve significantly.

## ⚠️ Warning

If you:
- Blindly apply an R library package, or
- Use plain linear regression without exploration

You may end up with an **MSE of 400,000 (!) or worse**.
