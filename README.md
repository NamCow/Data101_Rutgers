# Data101_Rutgers
## Running the Code (Important)

Each folder in this repository contains **one or more `.R` files** that must be run **together with the corresponding dataset files**.

**Important notes:**
- You must **download the dataset(s)** associated with each assignment or prediction challenge.
- The dataset files (`.csv`) must be placed **in the same folder** as the `.R` script.
- The code assumes the **original filenames** are preserved.
- Datasets are **not shared across folders** and are **not interchangeable**.
- If the setup above does not work, simply **update the file path in the R script** to match the actual location of the dataset on your machine.


### How to run
1. Open the assignment or prediction challenge folder in **RStudio** (or any R environment).
2. Set the working directory to that folder.
3. Make sure all required dataset files are present.
4. Run the `.R` script.
